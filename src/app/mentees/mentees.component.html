                After prospective mentees fill out our Google Application Form, W.in Debate will match them with mentors in their region that have similar debating styles and interests. All of our mentors have had a track record for success in debate, and were chosen because of their outstanding character and commitment to helping others. Mentees will then receive an email with their assigned mentor and their contact information when the matching process is complete. From there, mentees will be able to schedule video-chat sessions with their mentors to work on any debate skill of their choosing.
