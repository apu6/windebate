  This past season, I overheard a debater complaining about how difficult his opponents were at a tournament. “I was so unlucky!” he declared, boasting for the next ten minutes to anyone who would listen about how he still finished with a high win-loss record. Yet, even though his ten-minute rant was about difficult debate opponents, he failed to mention the <i> only </i> debater who he actually lost to. She was a woman. Coincidence?

<br>
<br>

The arrogance of this man’s behavior is a testament to the double-edged nature of debate: on the one hand, the activity can empower students to find and use their voice. But on the other, the gratification debate brings can transform debaters from courteous intellectuals into haughty know-it-alls. Although debaters of all genders can experience this change, it disproportionately affects men, who are rewarded with high speaker points, among other things, for their perceptual dominance.

<br>
<br>
In my last article, I touched upon the “bro culture” that surrounds debate, highlighting how small, subtle, and seemingly innocuous acts by male debaters demean women and other gender minorities. Whether it’s the crowd of “bros” that swarms a male debater after he finishes his last rebuttal, the “locker room talk” men engage in online and at tournaments, or debate’s tolerance for openly misogynist individuals, the “bro culture” undeniably exists. But something I failed to fully address is the role that arrogance plays in upholding this toxic and misogynistic environment. 

<br>
<br>
Debate, being an educational activity at its core, is filled with people who are accustomed to succeeding in academic environments. But unlike the classroom setting of school, where a student is surrounded by others trying to absorb the same subject, there can only be one winner in debate. As debaters scramble to elevate their status in the debate world, a new trait develops: arrogance. This process culminates in the belief that to win a debate is to be “better,” “superior” even, than your opponent - valuing competitive success over character. And, like I said in my last article, it is this belief in superiority over others that sets the stage for exclusive cliques of men, or “bro’s clubs,” to form. When competitive success becomes the preeminent concern, many feel justified in looking beyond character flaws (such as sexism) for the sake of popularity and a better reputation, or “rep.”
<br>
<br>
It only takes a few minutes of watching groups of male debaters interact to be astounded by the arrogance they exhibit. I have witnessed male debaters spend unprecedented amounts of time, in one case over an hour, bragging about the debates they have won, recounting every mistake their opponents made. Sometimes, they will even boast about debates that they won <i>years</i> ago. I have almost never observed the same levels of arrogance from women in debate, and they are rarely ever a part of these supercilious conversations. 
<br>
<br>
Arrogance moves from the individual level to the collective when people attempt to rank debaters and make predictions on the macro scale. Often times, discussions of “who is the better debater” turn into mass criticizing sessions, picking apart a debater’s success and ability. Coupled with debate’s immense gender disparity, these seemingly ubiquitous criticisms of skill are disproportionately weaponized against women. Entire groups of insecure male debaters (and even coaches) resort to sexism, doubting the successes of women in the activity and slandering them as “bad debaters” through whichever contrived insults they can think of. Male debaters and coaches do not usually intend to target women, but when men form groups, it's the people on the outside (such as women and gender minorities) who inevitably get criticized. And when they’re not being made fun of, women, people of color, and gender minorities are completely left out of these "rep" discussions altogether.
<br>
<br>
It is telling that <i> all</i> of the men that I have witnessed continually criticize women’s successes are plagued by arrogance. Their attempt to establish a foothold in debate’s social hierarchy, one that is defined by competitive success, comes at the expense of women. And once you’re in the “bro club,” those very same misogynists won’t criticize your debating -- a free pass that women never get.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps the clearest example of male arrogance is when a male debater loses to a woman. When this happens, the reaction of other male debaters is almost always one of shock and surprise. In many cases, this surprise persists even when the male opponent had a far inferior competitive record than the woman he lost to. This year at the Yale Invitational, I watched as a woman defeated many well-known debaters and somehow, with each successive win, people continued to be shocked. How many good debaters does she have to beat before people stop acting surprised? The community has a surprisingly short term memory for the successes of women, while men tend to remember every impressive win they and their friends have secured.
  <br>
  <br>
  And what’s worse, and where extreme amounts of arrogance come into play, is that many men will refuse to acknowledge the woman’s win was legitimate. There’s always an excuse- the judge made the wrong decision; the loss was a “hack”; she only won because she was a woman. I’ve even witnessed this occur when not one, but <i>three </i> judges on a panel voted for a woman. Sometimes, however, these men can’t find an excuse - the woman just very clearly won the debate. In these instances, instead of defending the male debater, they will “meme” the debate round into oblivion, making jokes out of any part of the debate they can remember and posting them on Facebook. They find it super <i>hilarious</i> and unusual when a woman just objectively wrecks a male debater in a round. By making fun of legitimate victories, these men trivialize the successes of women; their wins become sources of embarrassment rather than pride. Male arrogance creates a double standard: men who win are lauded, but women who win aren’t taken seriously, even when a third-party judge votes for them.
  <br>
<br>
It is troubling that many older, upperclassmen debaters and even coaches fit these descriptions of haughty, arrogant individuals. Though we all have had moments where we’ve been boastful, the behavior of many of these debaters can be characterized by full-blown hubris. As younger debaters idolize these men, who seem to comprise a large part of the debate community, a cycle is created, and the arrogance continues year after year. It is almost as if the boastful conversations, the criticisms, and the conceited attitude constitute a rite of passage for male debaters as they become older and more successful. There’s no incentive for men to stop the arrogant behavior as long as they’re idolized -- they’re applauded for bragging about themselves and their debates, getting an ego boost every time.  
  <br>
  <br>
  The community desperately needs a reformation of what behavior it continues to validate. It’s time to stop idolizing, year after year, the same arrogant men who can’t seem to ever accept losing, let alone to a woman. 
  <br>
  <br>
  There’s no simple way to bring about the cultural shift I am advocating for. It won’t happen overnight. But things as straightforward as telling groups of men to stop criticizing women’s debate records or calling out arrogance will have an immense effect on the culture. Don’t buy into it when male debaters recount their debate stories excessively -  it's really easy to brush them off by saying "congrats, but you've been talking about this debate for 45 minutes." When you talk about who is the most successful debater, think about who you're including on that list. Support your friends in debate, but do so in a constructive way that does not involve condoning their trash-talking of other debaters. If you’re a judge, lower the speaker points of a condescending and snarky competitor. Finally, self-reflect: why are you surprised when consistently successful women continue to win debates?
  <br>
  <br>
  Hopefully as the community begins to recognize arrogance for what it is, we can slowly eliminate the cutthroat nature of debate and transform it into a more inclusive and kind activity.
