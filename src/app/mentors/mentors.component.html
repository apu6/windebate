                            circuits. She has reached elimination rounds and won speaker awards 
                            throughout the year, finishing as a semi-finalist at Princeton and 
                            quarter-finalist at NDCA. She was a lab assistant at the Lexington 
                            Debate Institute this past summer, and she's really excited to be 
                            working with Women in Debate. She wants to share her love for debate 
                            with other girls and help them through the activity.

                                  Madi wanted to become a mentor to not only be there emotionally for other women, but also to help foster improvement in debating skill. Her experience of being a women in debate is one full of triumphs and tribulations. Madi understands what it is like to be looked down upon and held to a lower standard just because you are a woman. Further, she knows what it is like to be truly uncomfortable, and at times feel unsafe, as a woman in debate.

However, not all women in debate that would like/benefit from this kind of bond are able to access it close to home (she recognizes she was lucky in that sense), so she wanted to be part of a program that helps facilitate these friendships and connections for young women.                              </p>

                                  Abby Morris is a sophomore at Lake Highland. Abby started debate in 7th grade, so she was a lot younger than most people, and it made her quickly realize the importance of having women as mentors. She was always uncomfortable working with the guys because she felt intimidated by them, and having older female teammates really helped her. That’s why she thinks W.in debate is so great; everyone deserves the ability to work and sometimes just talk to a female mentor, even if they don’t have one on their team.
